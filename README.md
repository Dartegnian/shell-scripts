# *nix Shell Scripts
Shell scripts for Unix-based systems, mostly for Linux.

## What's inside

### Backup script
State-of-the-art, performant, Excel-spreadsheet-driven script to backup all my precious dotfiles without the need for me to manually transfer the configuration scripts to The Cloud™.

### GAME MODE™
GAME MODE `ON`/`OFF` turns on GAME MODE™ for my Linux system.

### Maim screenshot taker
Takes a screenshot with `maim` with `--screen`/`-s`, `--screen-temp`/`-t`, `--area`/`-a` as parameters.

### Microphone toggler
Toggles between muting and unmuting the default microphone source in PulseAudio and shows a desktop notification.

### MOTD updater
Configures the MOTD in my Linux system to mimic that of the startup messages in AT&T Unix System V because it looks cool.

### Restic file backup
Uploads configured folders and tags onto some cloud storage solution.

### Update script
Thingamajig that updates your ((Arch)) Linux install and all the penguins inside. Written by me, for me, and probably only used by me. I'm trying my best in writing a shell script, okay? Hmph.
